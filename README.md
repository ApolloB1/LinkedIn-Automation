### Notes
The script by default take from you the username and password, and authenticating to linkedin with those credentials, then go to mynetwork page on linkedin and start the connections sending process until the ```You're out of invitations``` message appear, then the program terminated, all this process is unvisible by default.

To make this process visible just make this change in code ```visibel = 1```.
To make this script not asking for your credentials and run at once, you can but your credentials in the ```username``` parameter and ```password``` parameter in the code.

This script runs only on linux, and that's it.
