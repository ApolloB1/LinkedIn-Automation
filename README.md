# LinkedIn-Automation
Automate the process of connection sending, and grow your network fastly.

### Setup

```
bash linkedin.sh
```

### Usage

```
python linkedin.py
```

### Notes
The script by default take from you the username and password, then authenticating to linkedin with those credentials, then go to mynetwork page on linkedin and start the connection sending process until the ```You're out of invitations``` message appear, then close the program, all this process is unvisible by default.

To make this process visible just make this change in code ```visibel = 1```.
To make this script not asking your credentials and run at once, you can but your credentials in the ```username``` parameter and ```password``` parameter.

And that's it.
